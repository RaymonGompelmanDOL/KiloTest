    <h1>The Quiet Road Test</h1>
    <div class="meta">A short story about cars, small decisions, and long drives.</div>

    <p>
      The dealership smelled like new upholstery and old coffee. Ray didn’t come for the smell, though—
      he came for the silence. That’s what the salesperson had promised: a car so quiet you could hear
      your own thoughts clicking into place.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside, the city was practicing its usual chaos: buses wheezing, scooters darting, a delivery van
      insisting it owned the lane. The car—dark paint, clean lines—waited like it had already forgiven
      the world for being noisy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ray slid into the driver’s seat. The door closed with a soft, confident thud. No drama, no rattle,
      just a reassuring seal. When he pressed the start button, nothing roared awake. The dashboard lit
      up like a calm sunrise, and that was it—ready.
    </p>

    <p>
      They rolled out onto the road, and the first surprise wasn’t speed. It was how the car handled
      hesitation. Ray’s foot hovered, expecting the old delay, the engine deciding whether to cooperate.
      Instead, the car moved as if it had been listening the whole time.
    </p>

    <p>
      “It’s weird,” Ray said, smiling a little. “It feels… polite.”
    </p>

    <p>
      The salesperson laughed. “Polite cars are underrated.”
    </p>

    <p>
      At the first set of lights, Ray watched a battered hatchback pull up beside them—dings, scratches,
      and a bumper held on by optimism. The driver drummed the steering wheel, impatient, eyes forward.
      Ray felt a strange fondness for it. That car had stories in its panels.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the light turned green, the hatchback shot off like it was late for something important.
      Ray didn’t chase. The quiet car glided along, steady and unbothered, as if saying: we can arrive
      without proving anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      They took the long route, where the road curved out past the last row of shops and into open space.
      Trees leaned in like spectators. The tyres hummed a soft note against the tarmac. Ray loosened his
      grip on the wheel, and for a moment the day stopped pushing.
    </p>

    <p>
      “You know,” he said, “I always thought I wanted a car that felt powerful.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “And now?” the salesperson asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ray glanced at the dash—simple, clear, patient. He looked at the road—wide enough for mistakes.
      “Now I think I want one that makes me calmer.”
    </p>

    <p>
      On the way back, they passed the battered hatchback parked at the curb, hazard lights blinking like
      a confession. The driver was on the phone, gesturing wildly. Ray felt the quiet car slow smoothly,
      giving space without being asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      The dealership came back into view. Ray parked, and the silence returned, waiting for his decision.
      He didn’t feel sold to. He felt understood.
    </p>

      The end — and maybe the beginning of a longer drive.
